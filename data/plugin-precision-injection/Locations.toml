# A dictionary for assigning injection locations to specific files.
# Files not assigned a location will be injected by default when
# the `inject.html` partial is invoked with an empty location value.
# How locations are named and assigned is entirely up to you, as you 
# will be the one passing them as parameters when invoking the partial
# from your theme or plugin to inject the associated file list.
#
# Here's how mine happens to look:
# HEAD_TOP = [ "google-tag-manager-head-script.html" ]
# ABOVE_HEADER = [ "google-tag-manager-header-script.html" ]
#

HEAD_TOP = [ "plugin-google-tag-manager/injection.html" ]
# ABOVE_HEADER = []
# BELOW_HEADER = []
# FOOTER = []
