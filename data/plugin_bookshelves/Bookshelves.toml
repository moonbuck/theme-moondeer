# Bookshelf registry
####################

# A registered bookshelf is composed of the following:
# • The entry's array item umbrella: [[Registered]]
# • A 'Key' entry with the bookshelf's lookup key.
# • An optional 'DisplayName' entry with markdown to parse as the bookshelf's header.
# • An optional 'Description' entry with markdown to parse as the bookshelf's description.
#
# An example might look like the following:
#
# [[Registered]]
# Key = 'currentlyreading'
# DisplayName = 'Currently Reading'
# Description = '*Books I am somewhat in the process of reading*'
