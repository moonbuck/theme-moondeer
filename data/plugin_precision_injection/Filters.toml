# A dictionary for restricting a file's injection by page path.
# When an plugin include appears as a key in this dictionary,
# it will only be injected into page's whose path has been
# included in the assigned list.
#
# Here's how mine looks:
# "category-cloud-style.html" = [ "/cloud/" ]
# "/assets/css/gallery.css" = [ "/gallery/" ]
# "/assets/css/bookshelves.css" = [ "/bookshelf/" ]
# "/assets/js/bookshelves.js" = [ "/bookshelf/" ]
